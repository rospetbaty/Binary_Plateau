Introduction
============

A binary plateau within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive ones in the binary representation of N.

For example, number 14 has binary representation 1110 and contains a binary plateau of length 3. The number 758 has binary representation 1011110110 and contains two binary plateaus: one of length 4 and one of length 2.

This small function enables the user to calculate the binary plateau of any integer
